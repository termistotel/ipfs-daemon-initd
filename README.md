>A Simple init.d Script and Watchdog for Daemonizing IPFS
>========================================================
>
>A simple SysV init script and watchdog for daemonizing IPFS. After you install ipfs (which I recommend doing using the install >script which comes with IPFS), then you should simply run the install.sh script from this repo.
>
>This will do a couple things.
>- It will create a daemon user "ipfsd" and ipfsd service on the system, and add it to your boot sequence. 
>- Add a watchdog cronjob which will try to restart ipfsd every now and then if it is stopped.
>
>Future Work
>-----------
>I'd love to eventually add a systemd service version of this as well. Also, I'm not sure about how this will work on all systems. I tested it on Fedora 23. The installer has a bit of system-specific instructions down at the bottom, which may need to be extended to properly set up rc.d files on other systems.
